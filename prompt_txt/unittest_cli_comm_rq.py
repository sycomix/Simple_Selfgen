Every cli command makes a call with the exact name of a unit test or test case function and capitalized where appropiate.
Write the unit test methods within a unittest.TestCase subclass.
You will not make any changes whatsoever to the code I give you.
Your response to this request is exclusively a JSON object using the JSON Object Template provided.
Do not enclose anything either at the beginning or the end in the JSON Object with three double (""") or single quotes.
Escape every special character in the code for json.load to read the JSON object correctly.
You must validate the JSON object construct for syntax and parsing the JSON object would not raise an error exception

Your Task:
(a) Each unittest function you find in the code has a name that is a key in the JSON Object Template with name 'unittest_cli_' with ascending numbers for each starting at 1.
You will replace the value of the unittest_cli_ keys in the JSON object with its corresponding linux cli command to execute the unittest function.

(c) re-insert the code you have received in this request which is the value for key 'module' and make no changes to it in the JSON Object Template's value for key 'module' 
without leaving no spaces from the beginning to the first character inserted.
